 Smart Dustbin

This project implements a smart dustbin system using Arduino, capable of automatically opening its lid when motion is detected and sending alerts when the garbage level reaches a certain threshold.

Features

- Automatic lid opening/closing based on motion detection.
- Ultrasonic sensor to measure garbage level.
- LCD display for real-time monitoring.
- Full alert notification with simulated GPS coordinates/location.

Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- PIR Motion Sensor
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo Motor
- LCD Display (16x2)
- Jumper Wires

Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the `smart_dustbin.ino` sketch to your Arduino board.
3. Connect the components according to the pin configurations specified in the sketch.
4. Power on the Arduino and monitor the LCD display for real-time updates.

Usage

1. Ensure that the dustbin lid is closed initially.
2. When motion is detected near the dustbin, the lid automatically opens.
3. Once the lid is open, users can dispose of garbage into the dustbin.
4. The ultrasonic sensor measures the garbage level and displays it on the LCD.
5. When the garbage level exceeds 80%, a full alert is sent with simulated GPS coordinates/location.
6. The lid automatically closes after 5 seconds of no motion detection.
